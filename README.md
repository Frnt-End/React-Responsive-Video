:point_right: [Watch DEMO](https://frnt-end.github.io/React-Responsive-Video/) 


## Start

Add your video file and import it, in this case, we added a file named 'vid-bg.mp4' inside a directory called 'video':

##### `import BgVideo from './video/vid-bg.mp4';`

Now we will embed the video using the `<video>` html tag:


##### `<video autoPlay loop muted className="bg-vid"><source src={BgVideo} type="video/mp4" /> </video>`

## Finish

Our last step is setting the **CSS style**:


##### `.bg-vid { position: fixed; width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover; z-index: 0; }`

***

##### And that's it! no third party and no packages..  :statue_of_liberty:
